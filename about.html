        Anxiety is the feeling of fear, worry, or even nervousness about what might happen. 
        It's kind of like the feeling you get before taking a big test or speaking in front of an audience. Everyone feels anxious sometimes, so remmeber, you're not alone!

        Anxiety can also have several negative impacts on your life such as diminishing your self-esteem and dignity, and also making it hard to enjoy and focus on things.
        Now, I know it may seem like you have a "problem" but it's completely okay to feel like this and you should never be guilty for feeling something.

            <h1 class="left-display"> Overthinking is when you dwell on the same thought or situation over and over to the point it disrupts your life. It's when you constantly go over the same situation which has already happened or which will happen. This often leads to feelings of fear, worry, and mostly, doubt. These feelings can often tamper with your relationships with others, decision making abilities, and overall sense of well-being, leading to a cycle of stress and uncertainty.
    </p> 
            Now it may be very overwhelming and negative but there's one thing that you should always remember, "you are not alone!". And it's completely normal and okay to feel this way and have these thoughts. Although overthinking can be very challenging and it may seem like there is no hope or you don't know how to fix it, there are actually plenty of solutions! And that's what our website aims to do.
